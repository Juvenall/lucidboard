TODO
====================

List of things any dev can jump in and take care of. Feel free to add.
----------------------------------------------------------------------


+   Fix issue where a user can create a new column with no column title. This breaks UI ( should we do a UI solution or validation?)
+   Review mobile experience
+   make alarm  timer pulse
+   figure how to add cards back to the board
+   Make trash icon have trash in it?

Adam's List:

- Fix moveCard routine. I think piles broke it.
- forward()/back() frontend/backend things for piles.
- numbers on the cards and columns preceding the text?
- way to delete boards? columns?
